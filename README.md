Summary
I am Parag Ghatage, a full stack web developer specializing in Next.js. I developed Explora, a travel planning app that allows users to explore photos, check real-time weather, and plan trips with accommodation and travel options. It uses technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and various APIs. I also created Thunder-Tube, a YouTube clone with features like subscriptions, likes, playlists, and secure login with JWT. Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology at Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology in Pune, India.
